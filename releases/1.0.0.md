## Arches Modular Reports 1.0.0 beta Release Notes

## How to setup Arches Modular Reports for your project

## 1. Installation
`Important`: Installing the arches-modular-reports app will install Arches as a dependency. This may replace your current install of Arches with a version from PyPi. If you've installed Arches for development using the `--editable` flag, you'll need to reinstall Arches using the `--editable` flag again after installing arches-modular-reports

### If installing for development
Clone the arches-modular-reports repo and checkout the latest `dev/x.x.x` or any other branch you may be interested in. 
Navigate to the `arches-modular-reports` directory from your terminal and run:
 ```
pip install -e .
 ```

### If installing for deployment, run:
```
pip install arches-modular-reports
```

## 2. Project Configuration

If you don't already have an Arches project, you'll need to create one by following the instructions in the Arches [documentation](http://archesproject.org/documentation/).

When your project is ready add "arches_modular_reports", "arches_querysets", and "arches_component_lab" to INSTALLED_APPS **below** the name of your project:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    "my_project_name",
    "arches_modular_reports",
    "arches_querysets",
    "arches_component_lab"
)
```

Next ensure arches, arches_modular_reports, dayjs, @primevue/forms, and @primeuix/themes are included as dependencies in package.json
```
"dependencies": {
    "arches": "archesproject/arches#stable/7.6.12",
    "arches-modular-reports": "archesproject/arches-modular-reports#main",
    "dayjs": "^1.11.13",
    "@primevue/forms": "4.3.3",
    "@primeuix/themes": "1.0.1"
}
```

Update urls.py to include the arches-modular-reports urls
```
urlpatterns = [
    ...
]

urlpatterns.append(path("", include("arches_modular_reports.urls")))

# Ensure Arches core urls are superseded by project-level urls
urlpatterns.append(path("", include("arches.urls")))

```

Run migrations
```
python manage.py migrate
```

Start your project
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Next cd into your project's app directory (the one with package.json e.g. `$PROJECT_NAME/`) install and build front-end dependencies:
```
npm install
npm run build_development
```
