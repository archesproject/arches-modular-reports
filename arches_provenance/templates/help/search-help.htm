                <p>{% blocktrans %}The <a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/provenance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getty Provenance Index</a> provides open access to millions of resources from dealer stock books and sales catalogs through a Getty-supported, open-source database platform. These datasets provide essential information on the ownership and market histories of artworks.<br><br>
                    In Arches, Getty Provenance Index data is generated through events. Often, but not always, these events are related to historic transfers of ownership. These events create data that populates one of nine Resource Models used in the Provenance Index: Activity, Group, Person, Physical Object, Place, Provenance Activity, Set, Textual Work, and Visual Work. These models are based on the
                    <a href="https://linked.art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linked.Art</a> metadata application profile of the <a href="https://cidoc-crm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIDOC-CRM</a> reference model. <br><br>
                    For more information about how Arches defines Resource Models, Branches, and Nodes, see <a href="https://www.archesproject.org/arm-wg-documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arches Modeling Documentation</a>.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

                <p>{% blocktrans %}The “Search” function of the Getty Provenance Index in Arches allows users to query Provenance Index resources to locate data of interest. Upon creating a search using the Search Bar or Search Tools, links to resources, called “cards”, populate Search Results. Search Tools can be used to further refine, visualize, or export results, often in the Search Panel.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                <p>{% blocktrans %}<strong>Search Bar</strong> {% endblocktrans %}</p>
                <p>{% blocktrans %}The Search Bar allows users to construct Simple Searches and acts as an aggregator of all enabled filters, including those in Advanced Searches. Logographs, diacritics, and unicode special characters are also supported in search.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                <p>{% blocktrans %}<strong>Search Tools</strong> {% endblocktrans %}</p>
                <p>{% blocktrans %}The Search Tools area provides access to the
                     <strong>Advanced Search</strong>, <strong>Related Resources</strong>, <strong>Resource Details</strong>, <strong>Saved Search</strong>, <strong>Time Filter</strong>, and <strong>Export Search Results</strong> tools mentioned throughout the User Guide.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                <p>{% blocktrans %}<strong>Search Results </strong> {% endblocktrans %}</p>
                <p>{% blocktrans %}For any search, a filtered list of updated resources appears in Search Results. Results are displayed as cards, which list the name of the resource and a relevant subfield. Clicking on the name of the resource in a card opens that resource in a new tab. Below the resource name, two buttons open Search Tools resource previews: “Resource Details” and “Related Resources”.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

Multiple keywords can be entered in the search bar to run an “AND/OR” query. Simple Search can also activate a “NOT” search by clicking on an entered keyword. Doing so will add a minus sign (-) before the keyword(s) and filter for all resources that do not contain the selected terms. Click the ‘x’ next to a keyword or filter to clear it.

                    <p>{% blocktrans %}The Advanced Search tool features facet search for multidimensional filtering, enabling users to select multiple criteria simultaneously to execute complex queries. Advanced Search facets are generated from the Getty Provenance Index  <strong>Resource Models</strong> to allow for filtering at the model, branch, sub-branch, and field level. <br><br>
                        The Advanced Search interface has two sections: Search Facets on the right, which lists branches and sub-branches available for query, and the Search Panel in the center, where search criteria are added to selected facets. Adding and removing search criteria to facets in the Search Panel automatically refines resources appearing in Search Results. <br><br>
                        To begin an Advanced Search, users must select a facet, either by navigating to the desired branch or sub-branch facet using the accordion buttons or via search at the top of the Search Facets area. Once a facet is selected, the Search Panel will show the selected branch and fields for adding search criteria. <br><br>
                        Multiple facets can be selected in an Advanced Search from the Search Facets panel. As additional facets are added to the Search Panel, a Boolean search operator will appear between selected facets, allowing users to define AND/OR facet relationships in their queries. Individual Advanced Search facets can either be removed by clicking the “Remove” button in the relevant facet in the Search Panel and all Advanced Search facets can be removed by clicking the “x” next to “Advanced Search” in the Search Bar or by clicking “Clear Filters” below the Search Bar.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

Branches consist of nodes and relationships based on semantic triples
                        (see: The <a href="https://www.archesproject.org/arm-wg-documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arches Modeling Documentation</a> for more info).
